This guide covers three primary authentication methods used in Ansible:

1. **Ansible PasswordLess Authentication**
2. **Ansible Password Authentication**
3. **Ansible Vault**

## 1. Ansible PasswordLess Authentication

Ansible PasswordLess Authentication allows you to securely manage remote nodes without the need to enter a password for every operation.

### Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair

On the Ansible control node, generate an SSH key pair if you don't already have one:

- **Enhanced Security (4096-bit RSA keypair):**

  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
